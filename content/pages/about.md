My name is Will Mruzek.

I'm software engineer currently working at Spredfast in Austin, TX.

I'm passionate about digital privacy and politics (especially involving technology).

I've been known to sing (occasionally in public), make experimental and documentary short films, and get excited about cutting-edge technology.
